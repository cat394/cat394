## ðŸš€ About Me

Hello, My name is Ryo.

I love web and enjoy creating creative websites.

I am a big fan of Typescript.

I like web components, especially the encapsulated styling with shadow DOM.

Recently, I created a small CSS framework based on web components. It is an interesting approach to inline styling, but I eventually realized that this project was a flop...

## ðŸŽˆHobby

I love anime.

List of my favorite anime:

- Steins; Gate
- Violet Evergarden
- Bakemonogatari (monogatari series)
- IDï¼šINVADED

...etc

If I start talking about anime, I'll end up with the world's longest readme file, so I won't go into detail hereðŸ˜œ
