# Hi, I'm Kokomi! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

Hello there! I’m Kokomi, a front-end enthusiast with a love for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Crafting websites using React, Svelte, and Astro is my forte, and I’ve recently ventured into the world of Web Components, developing a simple SPA router. My goal is to create fun, innovative projects that spark joy and curiosity. 🌟

Like embarking on a new adventure, writing code for me is about exploring uncharted territories and bringing creative ideas to life. I treasure calm moments in nature and unexpected discoveries in new places, much like finding elegant solutions in my coding journey. Just as I enjoy the tranquility of forests 🌲 and the mystery of hidden springs, I find peace and excitement in solving complex challenges and learning something new every day. 🧠

Stay tuned as I share my technical journeys and occasional escapades into the natural world. Whether you’re here for the code or the stories of adventure, I hope you find something that resonates with you. 🌍

Let’s embark on this journey together, and may each line of code and every path explored bring us closer to understanding the vast, beautiful world we live in. ✨
